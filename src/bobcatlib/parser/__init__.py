"""The Bobcat source document parser module.

Here, the input file is read in and transformed to an abstract syntax tree
(AST).  The nodes in this tree are objects, and they represent the objects in
the document: Section, paragraphs, tables etc.  Additionally, there is some
administrative stuff like meta data.  The classes defined here not only
represent a certain document structure, they also contain the code so parse
their region in the source document.  So in a way, the AST generates itself.

In the second phase, the AST can be told to create the output document (e.g. a
LaTeX file).  Then, the AST is walked through in a recursive manner and every
node generates ("emits") a certain fraction of output code.  This is realised
by code injection from the backend module into the classes of the parser.

This is the package initialisation file for the parser package.  It just
includes all parser components and exports them as if there was one big parser
module."""
