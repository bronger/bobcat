"""Codec class for safe filenames.  Safe filenames work on all important
filesystems, i.e., they don't contain special or dangerous characters, and
they don't assume that filenames are treated case-sensitively.

    >>> u"hallo".encode("safefilename")
    'hallo'
    >>> u"Hallo".encode("safefilename")
    '{h}allo'
    >>> u"MIT Thesis".encode("safefilename")
    '{mit}_{t}hesis'
    >>> u"Gesch\\u00e4ftsbrief".encode("safefilename")
    '{g}esch(e4)ftsbrief'

Of course, the mapping works in both directions as expected:

    >>> "{g}esch(e4)ftsbrief".decode("safefilename")
    u'Gesch\\xe4ftsbrief'
    >>> "{mit}_{t}hesis".decode("safefilename")
    u'MIT Thesis'
