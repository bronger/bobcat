"""The emitter is an object which organises output generation.  This module
exports all of its functionality by the class `Emitter`."""

class Emitter(object):
    """Class for output generators.

    The emitter is an object which holds all the output data and organises the
    generation of the final output.  In the simplest case, this is a file.
    Howver, sometimes some post-processing is necessary.  For example, the
    generated LaTeX file must be transformed to a PDF.

    Additionally, some output types may generate a whole bunch of files
    (e.g. HTML, and even more so if you want to have each chapter in its own
    file).  Then, generatin the output is more than just concetanating
    `self.output`.

    The emitter is instantiatied in the backend module.  The parser module
    copies this into the `Document` object and passes the settings to it
    through `set_settings`.  Then, the actual processing is done on the AST,
    during which the `__call__` method is invoked very often with the generated
    output text (in the correct order).  Finally, the `Document` object in
    parser.py calls `do_final_processing`.  This method must be overridden in
    the derived class in the backend!  It can write self.output to a file for
    example or more.

    :ivar output: serialised output of the current document processing.
    :ivar settings: settings for the emitter like name of the input file and
      further generation details (e.g. whether HTML sing file/multiple file).

        clearer.  This method is called before any `__call__` or
        `do_final_processing` call so that you can use the settings in these
        methods.

        :Parameters:
          - `settings`: the output setting, e.g. the original input filename
